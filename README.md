# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch

ML-from-Scratch is my personal implementation of Machine Learning algorithms, built on **numpy** only, mainly done to understand more how the algorithms
work, illustrative jupyter notebooks are presented that will step you through to understand better how to use the implementation.

At this moment the implemented algorithms/notebooks are:

- [Mini_Bactch/Batch & Stochastic gradient descent linear Regressor](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/LinearReg.ipynb)
- [Mini_Bactch/Batch & Stochastic GD logistic (cross-entropy) Regressor](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/LogisticReg.ipynb)
- [KMeans Clustering Algorithm](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/KMeans.ipynb)
- [Multivariate Gaussian Distribution for Anomaly Detection](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/Mgd.ipynb)
- [Principal Component Alalysis (PCA) for Dimension Reduction](https://github.com/hbFree/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/PCA.py)

## Note
I don't recommend using the implementations for any reason but to learn from them, highly opimized Machine Learning librairies like 
**Tensorflow** and **Scikit-Learn** do tehe job faster and often offer GPU optimization.

## Dependencies
All you need to be able to use the files is python's **numpy**
